# TorchScript Benchmarks

This repo consists of a series of benchmarks on common models used in TorchScript and
a runner that handles gathering and pushing results. For details, see the [website readme](https://github.com/driazati/driazati.github.io/tree/master/torchscript).

For a quick example, see [`examples/backtest.sh`](examples/backtest.sh).
